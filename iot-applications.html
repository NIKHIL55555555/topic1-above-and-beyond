      <h2>IOT APPLICATIONS</h2>
      <P>
        IOT Applications Enables Communication Between Devices and is a collection Of Services And Software that
        Compiles
        Data Received From Connected Devices
        They Use Machine Learning To Analyze Large Amount Of Sensor Data In The Cloud and also it do not require any
        human
        involvment.For example: Smart Homes,
        Smart City,Self-driven Cars, GPS.
        Some main features are:
      <ul>
        <li>Real Time Operating System</li>
        <li>Remote Connectivity</li>
        <li>Backup data and security</li>
        <li>Integration and creation of ecosystems</li>
        <li>Data analyzation safety</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>SMART BUILDINGS</h2>
      <P>
        SMART BULDINGS is the bulding which allows to do some tasks like control building temperature, security,
        maintenance etc. using mobile devices and computers.It Includes the installation and use of integrated and
        advanced building automation system.
        Integrates technology and IoT solutions for issues such as overspend and inefficiency in building use and
        construction also Smart operations will help reduce wasted staff time and make your space smart.
        It should have the features like:
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time updates and centralized connectivity</li>
        <li>High security and reliability</li>
        <li>Low Cost Maintenance and lesser human efforts in decision making</li>
        <li>Self sustainable and sufficient in terms of requirements</li>
        <li>Minimal error in false case scenarios such as smoke sensor activating the fire alarm , motion sensor
          detecting
          motion and turning lights on etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>IOT INTERFACE</h2>
      <P>
        Full-fledged GUI control:
      </P>
    </div>
    <li> Automated Lighting,
      Energy efficiency,
      App controlled space booking,
      valuable assets,
      Building usage insights.
    </li>

    <h3>AI-controlled maintenance:</h3>
    <P>Full-fledged GUI control:</P>
    <li> optimum temperature control,
      optimum humidity control,
      clean air,
      resource optimization.
    </li>

    <h3>Security:</h3>
    <P>
      Firewalls and encryption on the web/LAN interface used to control the building.
    </P>

    <li> PIR motion sensor HC-SR501,
      MQ2 Smoke sensor module,
      LM393 Light Sensor module,
      Computing Device like microprocessors or microcontrollers such as arduino/raspberry pi/photon board etc.
    </li>
    <P>There are two types of users that can be identified in the given scenario-</P>
    <li> Recognizable user- The AI camera provided in the door recognizes the face of the user and allow them to
      enter
      the
      smart building. They are allowed to use other features like smart lighting system.
    </li>
    <li>Unrecognizable user- The AI camera fails to identify the user which will simultaneously capture the user
      image
      and send it to the registered email/phone number.
    </li>
